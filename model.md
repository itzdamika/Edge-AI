1. Import Libraries
OpenCV (cv2): Used for face detection (Haar Cascade) and image processing (resizing, displaying video frames).

NumPy (np): Used for array manipulations and mathematical operations (cosine similarity, loading/saving embeddings).

os: Used to handle file paths and directories.

tflite_runtime.interpreter (or tensorflow.lite): Handles the TensorFlow Lite interpreter to run the model on the device. This part is conditional based on whether tflite_runtime is available or TensorFlow is used directly.

2. Setup:
Model Path: The path to the TensorFlow Lite model (facenet.tflite) which will be used for face recognition.

Embeddings Directory: A directory (face_embeddings) where face embeddings will be saved or loaded.

Face Detection Parameters: FACE_DETECTION_SCALE and FACE_DETECTION_MIN_NEIGHBORS are parameters for detecting faces using the Haar Cascade classifier.

Matching Threshold: This is the cosine similarity threshold (0.7) above which faces are considered a match.

3. Face Detection Setup:
Haar Cascade Classifier: OpenCVâ€™s pre-trained face detector (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) is used to detect faces in the video stream.

4. TensorFlow Lite Model Setup:
TensorFlow Lite Interpreter: The tflite.Interpreter is used to load and allocate the face recognition model (facenet.tflite). The model is optimized for running on mobile and embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi.

Model Input and Output: The input and output details are fetched from the interpreter to ensure data is passed correctly for processing.

5. Embeddings Handling:
Load Embeddings: The function load_embeddings() reads previously saved face embeddings from .npy files in the face_embeddings directory. These embeddings represent unique features of known faces.

Save Embedding: The function save_embedding() saves the embedding for a recognized face to a .npy file. It sanitizes the name to remove non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring valid file names.

6. Face Processing Functions:
Preprocess Face: The function preprocess_face() resizes the detected face to 160x160 pixels and normalizes it to a range of [-1, 1], which is required for input to the model.

Get Embedding: The function get_embedding() takes the preprocessed face and passes it through the TensorFlow Lite model to obtain the embedding (a vector that represents the unique features of the face).

Cosine Similarity: The cosine_similarity() function compares the embedding of the current face with the saved embeddings to measure how similar they are. If the cosine similarity is above the matching threshold (0.7), the faces are considered to match.

7. Main Loop (Video Capture & Face Recognition):
Video Capture: The video feed from the camera is captured using cv2.VideoCapture(0), and each frame is processed to detect faces.

Face Detection: In each frame, the face_cascade.detectMultiScale() function detects faces using Haar Cascade. The function returns the coordinates (x, y, w, h) of each detected face, which are then used to crop the face region from the frame.

Face Recognition: For each detected face, the system preprocesses it, extracts the embedding using the TFLite model, and compares it with saved embeddings using cosine similarity:

Known Faces: If a match is found (similarity > threshold), the system labels the face with the name and similarity score.

Unknown Faces: If no match is found, the system labels the face as "Unknown".

Save New Face: If the user presses 's', the system enters "save mode", where the user is prompted to enter the name of the person. The system then saves the embedding of the detected face for future recognition.

Display: The processed frame with face bounding boxes, names, and similarity scores is displayed in a window. The user can exit the program by pressing 'q'.

8. Keyboard Controls:
q: Quits the program and closes the video stream.

s: Enters save mode, allowing the user to save new face embeddings with an associated name.
